# Strings are immutable sequences of Unicode characters in Python,
# serving as the fundamental data type for handling textual information

# 1.	Creating Strings -
#     - Single quotes
#     - double quotes
#     - triple quotes quotes
#     - raw strings quotes
#     - multiline strings
# Single and double quotes
# single_quoted = 'Hello, World!'
# double_quoted = "Python's string handling"
# mixed_content = 'He said "Hello" to me'
# print(single_quoted)
# print(double_quoted)
# print(mixed_content)
#
# # Triple quotes for multiline
# multiline = """This is a
# multi-line string
# with preserved formatting"""
# print(multiline)
# # Raw strings (escape sequences ignored)
# raw_string = r'C:\Users\name\Documents'
# print(raw_string)
#
# # Practice Exercise
# # 1.	Create a string containing both single and double quotes without escaping
# # 2.	Write a raw string representing a Windows file path with backslashes
# # ------------------------------------------------------------------
# # Solutions:
# # # Exercise 1
mixed_quotes = """He said 'Hello' and she replied "Hi there!" """
# #
# # # Exercise 2
# # windows_path = r'C:\Program Files\Python\Scripts\pip.exe'
